# basketball-statistics-FSC

This repository contains Python code for analyzing basketball statistics.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   Parses and analyzes basketball team data from a text file.
*   Provides a basic framework for statistical analysis using Python.
*   Includes a debug option for in-depth code inspection.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Python 3.x:**  The code is written in Python and requires a Python 3.x interpreter.
*   **argparse:** This module is part of the Python standard library, but ensure it's available.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/romenvii/basketball-statistics-FSC.git
    cd basketball-statistics-FSC
    ```

2.  **Ensure Python is installed:**

    Verify that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check this by running:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

To run the `stats.py` script:

```bash
python3 stats.py
```

The script accepts the following argument:

*   `--debug`: Enables the Python debugger (pdb) for detailed code analysis.

Example usage with debugging:

```bash
python3 stats.py --debug
```

This will start the script and enter the debugger, allowing you to step through the code and inspect variables.  Press `c` to continue running until a breakpoint (if set), or `n` to step to the next line.  Press `q` to quit debugging.

**Data Input:**

The script reads data from the `basketball_team2324.txt` file.  The format of this file is currently undefined; refer to the file itself for its structure.

## Configuration Options

The script's behavior can be modified by editing the global variables within the `stats.py` file.  These variables are typically defined at the top of the file and are denoted by `ALL CAPS`.

```python
import argparse
import pdb

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Python Sports Statistics")
parser.add_argument('--debug', help='use pdb to look into code before exiting program', action='store_true')

# Here are two examples of "global" variables. We typically define them at the top of the program so that they are
# easy to edit. Use ALL CAPS to distinguish globals from normal variables we define inside the main function.
# TODO: Edit these as needed or add other globals here i...
```

Currently, there are placeholder comments for these variables.  Future development should expand on defining specific configuration options here.
